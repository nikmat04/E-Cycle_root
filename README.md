# E-Cycle_root
BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
Our project was born from a collective concern within our team regarding the devastating environmental consequences of e-waste. In India, we face the alarming reality of being the "Third largest electronic waste producer in the world," with an annual generation of approximately 2 million tons of e-waste. We were compelled to take action upon witnessing the shocking accumulation of e-waste in landfills, which posed a grave threat to our environment and human well-being. This droves us to tackle this pressing global issue leading to the beginning of the E-Cycle.
1. The Website registers individuals willing to contribute their E-waste, capturing both their personal information and the precise details of the electronic device they plan to donate.
2. Our platform enables users to arrange pickups for their aging electronic devices, guaranteeing a hassle-free and environmentally responsible disposal process.
3. E-cycle assesses the condition of each device and extends the most favourable quote to the E-waste contributor, thereby promoting responsible recycling methods while benefiting the donor.
The E-Waste Collection Website came to life through a carefully crafted technology stack: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, complemented by Python with the Django framework for the backend. This harmonious combination empowered us to construct a seamlessly user-friendly platform, bridging the gap between individuals, businesses, and responsible e-waste disposal solutions.
